# A functional representation for graph matching
This work presents a functional representation for graph matching (FRGM). From the functional representation perspective, the matching between graphs can be reformulated as a linear functional between the function spaces of graphs for general graph matching. Moreover, it can be viewed as a new parameterization for Euclidean graph matching, which allows us to estimate the geometric parameters and correspondence simultaneously.
